v0.3.5 July 31, 2014 -- Made Client.gain_access method save homedoc as self.document. This is the first function anyone will run, so might as well make it useful. Added unittest to ensure this attribute is getting set.

v0.2.0 July 28, 2014 -- Built NavigableDoc model. pmp_client.Client can now `query` and it returns NavigableDoc elements on all results. Added unittests.

v0.1.0 July 25, 2014 -- Working client that can connect to base-url, request token, and navigate around. Next step: improved querying, href-templating, and models based on document profiles.

v0.0.3 July 24, 2014 -- Added unittests for all modules in pmp_api.core. Cleaned and refactored auth and conn. Refactored auth and separated PmpAccess into separate module. Added a bit of functionality to PmpClient, but this aspect is still in development.
